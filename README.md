# Super Decaying Simulator 2022

Yea

## I'm a modder writing a Botania addon and I would like to add compat with my flowers. What should I do?

I tried to provide an event for this but god i hate Forge's bullshit lol

Mixin to the end of `SuperDecayingSimulator2022#registerGeneratingFlowers`, or get in touch if you know how to make an event I can fire at other mods during the very-very-early loading process
